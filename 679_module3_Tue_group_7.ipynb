    "Yelp is a business directory service and crowd-sourced review forum which allows users to give reviews to businesses based on their own experience. It's easy for human to understand the sentiment behind the reviews, specifically whether a review is positive or negative, even without having any context about the business. However, there is a huge amount of reviews data on yelp, it's not realistic for business owners to go through every review by themselves to improve their performance. \n",

    "1.\tProvide useful, analytical insights to business owners on Yelp and, based on these insights, propose data-driven, actionable decisions to said owners in order to improve their ratings in Yelp. \n",
