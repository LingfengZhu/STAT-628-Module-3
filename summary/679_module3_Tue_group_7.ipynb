It's easy for human to understand the sentiment behind the reviews, specifically whether a review is positive or negative, even without having any context about the business. However, there is a huge amount of reviews data on yelp, it's not realistic for business owners to go through every review by themselves to improve their performance. \n","\n","Our project is aimed to:\n","\n","1.\tProvide useful, analytical insights to business owners on Yelp and, based on these insights, propose data-driven, actionable decisions to said owners in order to improve their ratings in Yelp. \n","2.\tBuild a web dashboard/widget/web application that visualizes your analysis and makes it easier to understand for business owners"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"bXs3gDhC9D57"},"source":["## The Dataset\n","There are four datasets provided, business data, review data, tip data, and user data.
